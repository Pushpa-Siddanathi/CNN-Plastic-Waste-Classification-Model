This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of plastic waste into various categories like organic and recyclable. The primary goal is to enhance waste management systems by improving the segregation and recycling process using deep learning technologies.

## Project Description  
Plastics are inexpensive, lightweight and durable materials, which are readily be moulded into a variety of products that find use in a wide range of applications. As a consequence, the production of plastics has increased markedly over the last 70 years. However, current levels of their usage and disposables generates various environmental problems. A major portion of plastic produced each year is used to make disposable items of packaging or other short-lived products that are discarded within a year of manufacture. The main goal of our application is to raise awareness about plastic hazards; and want to encourage people to learn the kind of plastic they use and which plastic is easily decomposed in the environment using Convolutional Neural Network. If you donâ€™t act now, in the future years there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. So, which helped to propose a novel model based on the deep learning mechanism by reading features of different plastic materials and then trained the model. Experimental results show the classifier give the results of the variant of plastic and the details like what it is kind of plastic its made of, whether it is recyclable or not and years taken to decompose, etc.

## Dataset  
The dataset used for this project is the **Waste Classification Data** by Sashaank Sekar. It contains a total of 25,077 labeled images, divided into two categories: **Organic** and **Recyclable**.  

### Key Details:
